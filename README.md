# Live Server - Web Extension
>**HELP! NEEDS A GOOD DOCUMENTATION [#4](https://github.com/ritwickdey/live-server-web-extension/issues/4)**

## Brief Description
This browser add-on is an extension for a developer tool in VS Code editor ([Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)). With this add-on installed, along with the VS Code extension, it gives you a functionality to automatically update your website on save; for other files than just `.htm` and `.html`.

So, more specifically, with this add-on, live reload will also work with the following server-side files like: `PHP`, `Node.js` and `ASP.NET`.

#### The Common Misconceptions
Neither the browser add-on nor the VS Code extension will host a server for: `PHP`, `ASP.NET` or `NodeJS`. It will give you the *reloading function*, so you do not need to refresh the page every time you save your server-side code.
