# Live Server - Web Extension

***[STILL IN UNDER DEVELOPEMENT]***

It is basically a browser extension that helps you to live reload feature for dynamic content (PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET -- Whatever, it doesn't matter). 
This extension is depended on `live-sever` (npm package) or `Live Server` (VS Code Extension - NOT CONFIG YET). [We have to use proxy server].
