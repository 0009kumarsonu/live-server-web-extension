# Live Server - Web Extension

***[STILL IN UNDER DEVELOPEMENT]***

It is basically a browser extension that helps you to live reload feature for dynamic content (PHP, Node.js, ASP.NET -- Whatever, it doesn't matter). 
This extension is depended on `live-sever` (npm package) or `Live Server` (VS Code Extension).

_[A Complete documention will be made ready very soon.]_

_[...And, Live Server for VsCode is not supported yet. Soon I'll configure the extension. For now, if you want to test the current process, install the extension in development mode in Google Chrome. Now, install the `live-server` package from npm. Open terminal/cmd in your workspace and type `live-server --proxy='/':'http://actualServerAddress/'`(We have to use proxy server). Now serve from the new url]_
