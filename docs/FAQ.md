I'm a new to this live server thing but for .html it worked perfectly fine! But now when I want to use it for .php it want's me to download it instead of executing it.  

How can I fix it?

2. You will need to install a server on your machine or download the necessary requirements. Here is a Stackoverflow question: [PHP server on local machine?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1678010/php-server-on-local-machine)
	+ [PHP](http://php.net/downloads.php) (just the preprocessor)
	+ [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (cross-platform)
	+ [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) (mac)
	+ [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) (windows)

>Neither the browser add-on nor the VS Code extension will host a server for: `PHP`, `ASP.NET` or `NodeJS`. It will give you the *reloading function*, so you do not need to refresh the page every time you save.

>The reason I built this browser add-on is to delight the experience of server-side programming. The server-side is heavier than the client-side because it needs a larger server environment to run and preprocess your code in: `php`, `nodejs` and `asp.net`.
